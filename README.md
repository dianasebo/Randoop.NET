# Randoop.NET
Randoop.NET is an API fuzzing unit test generator for .NET libraries.

There are two projects in the repository:

1. randoop-NET-src: this is a version of Randoop.NET by fixing a few bugs and incorporating a couple of new features (also upgraded to VS2010). The major differences between this version and the original tool are described in the document of "ChangeSets.docx".

2. randoop-VS-plugin-2015: this is a project that creates a GUI for the Randoop.NET and installs the tool as an add-in to the Visual Studio 2015. The introduction to this add-in is described in the document of "Randoop.NET VS add-in Manual.pdf".
